# Knee Osteoarthritis Detection using Deep Learning

This repository contains ongoing work for a project focused on detecting and grading knee osteoarthritis (OA) severity from X-ray images using deep learning techniques.

The project uses the Kellgren–Lawrence (KL) grading scale (Grades 0–4) and aims to build a complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and interpretability analysis.

## Current Status

The project is currently in the early implementation stage. The following components have been completed so far:

- Selection and integration of a public knee osteoarthritis X-ray dataset  
- Initial data exploration and class distribution analysis  
- Implementation of image preprocessing and augmentation pipeline  
- Baseline deep learning model using transfer learning (ResNet50)  
- Training and evaluation framework with accuracy and macro F1-score metrics  

Initial baseline experiments have been conducted to validate the pipeline.
